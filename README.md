# Email Survey Manager

Email Survey Manager is a full-stack React / Redux application allowing users to create and send mass email surveys to collect feedback results from recipients.  MongoDB / Mongoose are used to store data on the backend and authentication is done through Passport.js and Google OAuth.  In addition, I used Sendgrid API to send out emails to chosen recipients and webhooks to retrieve the reciepients responses through SendGrid.  In addition Stripe API is used for handling payments.  Modern ES6 syntax is used throughout the entire application and I have future plans to add more functionality including creating a better UI for creating custom survey emails and more useful statistics displays for survey recipient response data.
